## Abstract

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cookbook Connect is a website that will allow users to store and look up their handmade recipes. Users will either create an account or use their existing account to log in order to access tools to create and look up their recipes. There is no limit to the amount of recipes users can make.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Users will also have custom ways to store their recipes; either by type of food, or by preferred days of the week. This will allow for personalized organization as well as ensure users have a clear path to what they want to make and have for meals in case they donâ€™t know off the top of their head. They also have the ability to share their recipes as well as look up recipes from other users by searching or looking at a recommended recipe list.
